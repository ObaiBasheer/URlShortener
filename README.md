# URlShortener


Create a straightforward URL shortener with a simple design that generates short URLs of 7 characters length by selecting characters randomly from both lowercase and uppercase alphabets, 
along with numbers from 0 to 9. This approach doesn't rely on hashing functions to create short URL combinations. Additionally,
ensure that these short URLs can effectively redirect users to their corresponding long URLs.
